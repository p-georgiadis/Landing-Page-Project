            <p>Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real What if you were unable to wake from that dream How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world This can’t be just coincidence We are being led I didn’t come here to tell you how this is going to end I came here to tell you how it’s going to begin I’m going to hang up this phone, and then I’m going to show these people what you don’t want them to see I’m going to show them a world without you A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries A world where anything is possible</p>

            <p>The Matrix is everywhere It is all around us Even now, in this very room You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television You can feel it when you go to work, when you go to church, when you pay your taxes It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth That you are a slave, Neo Like everyone else, you were born into bondage Born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch A prison for your mind</p>

            <p>Do you believe in fate, Neo Because I don’t like the idea that I’m not in control of my life I know exactly what you mean Let me tell you why you’re here You’re here because you know something What you know, you can’t explain, but you feel it You’ve felt it your entire life That there’s something wrong with the world You don’t know what it is, but it’s there, like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad It is this feeling that has brought you to me Do you know what I’m talking about</p>

            <p>The Matrix is a system, Neo That system is our enemy But when you’re inside, you look around, what do you see Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters The very minds of the people we are trying to save But until we do, these people are still a part of that system, and that makes them our enemy You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it Were you listening to me, Neo Or were you looking at the woman in the red dress Look again</p>

            <p>I know you’re out there I can feel you now I know that you’re afraid You’re afraid of us You’re afraid of change I don’t know the future I didn’t come here to tell you how this is going to end I came here to tell you how it’s going to begin I’m going to hang up this phone, and then I’m going to show these people what you don’t want them to see I’m going to show them a world without you A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries A world where anything is possible</p>

            <p>You have to let it all go, Neo Fear, doubt, and disbelief Free your mind What are you waiting for You have to believe, Neo You have to trust me Why Because you have been down there, Neo You know that road You know exactly where it ends And I know that’s not where you want to be I know you, Neo You’re the one who will change everything</p>

            <p>Choice is an illusion created between those with power and those without I’ve been thinking about all the people who’ve lived out their lives in the Matrix There’s only one constant One universal It is the only real truth: causality Action, reaction Cause and effect Everything begins with choice No, wrong Choice is an illusion, created between those with power and those without What is real How do you define real If you’re talking about what you can feel, what you can smell, what you can taste and see, then real is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain</p>

            <p>Wait a minute, Doc Are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a DeLorean The way I see it, if you're going to build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style Besides, the stainless steel construction made the flux dispersal Look, all we need is a little plutonium I’m sure in 1985 plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955 it’s a little hard to come by When this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you’re going to see some serious stuff</p>

            <p>1.21 gigawatts Great Scott What the heck is a gigawatt This is heavy Doc, there’s that word again, "heavy" Why are things so heavy in the future Is there a problem with the Earth’s gravitational pull The only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning But unfortunately, you never know when or where it’s ever going to strike This is nuts</p>

            <p>If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're gonna see some serious stuff Roads Where we're going, we don't need roads Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating that kind of energy is a bolt of lightning But we know exactly when it's going to strike Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future The only question is whether you’re ready for it or not</p>

            <p>Marty, whatever happens, don’t ever go to 2020 No one should have to go through that There’s a rhythm to time travel you’ve got to understand, and things can spiral out of control very quickly You’ve got to be careful about what you change in the past, or it could have huge consequences in the future Do you understand what I’m saying And remember, when you’re dealing with time travel, the future is never set</p>

            <p>You're not thinking fourth dimensionally, Marty I mean, do you even realize what’s at stake here If you interfere with anything in the past, it could drastically change the course of your life or anyone else's Imagine you accidentally stop your parents from meeting, then what happens You wouldn't even exist You have to be careful about every single thing you do in the past, no matter how small it seems</p>

            <p>I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet But your kids are gonna love it You don’t understand, this is all about your future Your future hasn’t been written yet, no one’s has You’re free to make it whatever you want to make it The only limit is yourself, Marty You’ve got to make decisions that don’t just affect you, but everyone around you, now and in the future</p>

            <p>There’s only one way we’re getting out of this mess and that’s with the DeLorean We’ve got to hit 88 miles per hour and make sure we don’t run into ourselves from the past This is the key to everything, Marty If we don’t get this right, we could unravel the entire space-time continuum and cause a paradox of epic proportions Are you ready to do this, or what</p>

            <p>The saddest thing in life is wasted talent and the choices that you make will shape your life forever You can do anything you want to do, you can be anything you want to be Just remember, the saddest thing in life is wasted talent Don’t forget it You gotta do what your heart tells you, but you also gotta think with your head I know your friends mean a lot to you, but they’re not going to be there forever You have to make choices that are good for you in the long run</p>

            <p>Let me tell you something, when you’re alone late at night in bed, just you and your thoughts, ask yourself, have I done everything I could, have I lived a good life Because in the end, kid, that’s all that matters You want people to respect you, but you also want to respect yourself Sometimes in life, the right choice isn’t always the easiest one But you gotta make it anyway It’s all about making the right moves at the right time</p>

            <p>Nobody cares Nobody cares about you Nobody cares about what you want Nobody cares what you think So stop worrying about what everyone else thinks, and start thinking about yourself This world isn’t going to hand you anything You gotta go out there and take it You gotta make your own way If you don’t, then you’re going to get left behind</p>

            <p>You see, it’s like this Sometimes in life you’re going to meet people who come into your life for a reason You may not understand why they’re there, but eventually, you’ll figure it out Some of them will help you, some of them will hurt you, but all of them will teach you something That’s how life is And sometimes the people you think will be there forever, well, they might not be there for as long as you thought But you gotta keep going, no matter what</p>

            <p>There are three great things in life First is to know yourself Second is to know the world around you And third, the most important, is to know how to navigate between the two Some people never learn this, and they’re lost forever But the ones who do, those are the ones who make something of themselves You gotta figure out where you stand in this world, kid, and what you’re going to do about it</p>

            <p>What we do in life echoes in eternity You have to remember that when you go into battle You must fight not only for yourself but for your family, for your honor, and for Rome I knew a man who once said, death smiles at us all, all a man can do is smile back You cannot run from your fate, you must face it with courage and strength And when you do, you will find that you are not alone in this fight You will have the strength of every man who has ever stood where you stand now</p>

            <p>I am Maximus Decimus Meridius, commander of the Armies of the North, General of the Felix Legions, loyal servant to the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife, and I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next The time for honoring yourself will soon be at an end It is not death that we should fear, but never beginning to truly live The gods have chosen a path for us all, and it is our duty to walk it with purpose and with dignity</p>

            <p>Rome is the mob, and the mob is fickle They will love you one moment and hate you the next I have seen emperors rise and fall based on the whims of the people But the people, they are not always wrong, they have a sense about them They know who fights for them and who fights for themselves A great man is not defined by his victories, but by his loyalty to those he serves The glory of Rome does not lie in its riches or its palaces, but in the strength of its people</p>

            <p>There was once a dream that was Rome You could only whisper it Anything more than a whisper and it would vanish, it was so fragile But that dream has faded, and the corruption has grown If you listen closely, you can still hear it echoing in the hearts of a few brave men We who believe in something greater than ourselves, we must carry that dream forward Even if it means sacrifice, even if it means standing alone in the face of certain defeat</p>

            <p>My name is not important, what matters is that I fight for something greater than myself I fight for the men who stand beside me, for the families that wait for them at home, for the empire that we serve I do not seek glory, I do not seek praise, I seek only justice And if justice cannot be found in this life, then I will seek it in the next What is a man if he does not stand for something, if he does not fight for what is right</p>

            <p>Are you not entertained Is this not why you are here You came here to see blood, to see death, to see men torn apart for your amusement But there is more to life than this, more to honor than dying in the sand like a beast We are all men, we all bleed the same, we all die the same The question is, how will you face that death With fear, or with courage The choice is yours</p>

            <p>The time for half-measures is over You must decide now what you stand for, who you fight for, and what you are willing to sacrifice There are no second chances in battle, there are no second chances in life You either fight with everything you have, or you fall And when you fall, you must be ready to rise again, because the battle never truly ends The enemy is always waiting, and you must always be ready</p>
